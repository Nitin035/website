       <p class="text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition 
           of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational 
           methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. Education 
           frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate 
           themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that 
           has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. 
           The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

    <p class="text-small">Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under 
        the Islamic caliphate which was established across the Middle East, extending from the Iberian 
        Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire in 
        the south.
        The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and 
        appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed 
        a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of 
        Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across 
        the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations as with 
        the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, 
        and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese 
        scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of 
        a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western and Eastern education 
        is based on the Prussian education system.</p>

    <p class="text-small">This is ISCED level Primary (or elementary) education consists of the 
        first four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists 
        of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies 
        between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, of children aged six to 
        twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was rising. The 
        division between primary and secondary education is quite arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about 
        eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the 
        transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. 
        Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary 
        schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior schools.</p>
